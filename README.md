# Project-Bootcam-Data-Science
This project was build as a part of an assignment in my class as a data science training student.

In this project, I used Housing dataset that contains with different houses in Boston. This data retrived from Kaggel.

The dataset contains 13 feature variables. MEDV indicated the price of the house was used as target variable and the remaining were the feature variables. Linear reggresion was used in this model and compared the result from Ridge an Lasso.

Before doing the modeling, data exploratory was done so the data were clean and the outlier were minimize.
